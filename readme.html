Freelancing Platform - SIH 2024
Project Overview 
This project aims to create a comprehensive Freelancing Platform to connect freelancers with employers for short-term and project-based job opportunities. Developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH) 2024, the platform offers a seamless experience for both freelancers and employers, enabling efficient job postings, application management, and secure transactions.

Key Features
Freelance Job Marketplace: A dedicated marketplace where freelancers can discover job opportunities and employers can post project requirements and invite freelancers to apply.
Profile and Portfolio Management: Allows freelancers to create detailed profiles showcasing their skills, experiences, and a portfolio of past work, supported by a robust rating and review system.
AI-Based Recommendation System: Integrates AI to provide personalized job recommendations to freelancers and suggests suitable candidates to employers based on job requirements.
Extensive Search & Analytics: Facilitates comprehensive search capabilities and analytics to enable users to filter and find the most relevant job opportunities or candidates.
Escrow Account Management: Implements an escrow payment system to hold funds securely until the project is completed to the satisfaction of both parties, ensuring trust and security in financial transactions.


Solution Approach
AI Integration: The platform leverages AI-based recommendation engines through third-party APIs like IBM Watson, Google AI Recommendations, and Amazon Personalize, or custom models developed using Python libraries such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow.
Escrow System Implementation: Secure transactions are ensured by integrating WooCommerce with custom escrow management plugins, holding payments in escrow until the job is fully delivered and approved.
